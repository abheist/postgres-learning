- Cross joins
```sql
select * from letters; -- have 5 rows
select * from numbers; -- have 5 rows
select * from letters, numbers; -- have 25 rows, 5 x 5

-- cross join, every row on left join with right
-- cron join is default join for unqualified joins
select * from letter cross join numbers; -- give the same result

-- cool things to do
select letter || number -- a1, b1, c1...
from letters cross join numbers;

select upper(letter) || number -- A1, B1, C1...
from letters cross join numbers;


-- to generate these on the fly
select * from generate_series(1, 10) as numbers(n);
select chr(l) from generate_series(65, 75) as letters(l);

select (chr(l) || n) as code
from
	generate_series(1, 10) as numbers(n)
	cross join
	generate_series(65, 75) as letters(l);

-- A **CROSS JOIN** does not consider columns, relationships, or any join conditions. It simply combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table, producing a **Cartesian product**.
```
- Inner joins
```sql
-- Inner join gives you intersection of two tables based on specified condition

select user.user_id, users.first_name, bookmarks.id, bookmarks.url
from
	users join bookmarks on users.user_id = bookmarks.user_id

-- other syntax is by using 'using'
select user.user_id, users.first_name, bookmarks.id, bookmarks.url
from users join bookmarks using(user_id);
-- remember user_id columns should be present in both tables.
-- And if you do * on select, it will only show once column of user_id, which is good.
```
- Outer joins
```sql
/*
- outer joins have 3 categories
	- Left outer join
		- It gives you everything from left table and
		- matched data from right table
	- Right outer join
		- It gives you everything from right table and
		- matched data from left table
	- Full outer join
		- Give everything no matter what
*/

-- left join
select users.id, bookmarks.user_id, first_name, url
from 
	users left join bookmarks users.id = bookmarks.user_id;

-- right join
select users.id, bookmarks.user_id, first_name, url
from 
	users right join bookmarks users.id = bookmarks.user_id;

-- Full join
select users.id, bookmarks.user_id, first_name, url
from 
	users full join bookmarks users.id = bookmarks.user_id;
```
- Subqueries
```sql
select users.id, bookmarks.user_id, first_name, url
from 
	users left join bookmarks users.id = bookmarks.user_id;

-- okay, now if we only want the bookmarks which are using https only.
create index bookmarks_secure_url on bookmarks(user_id, (starts_with(url, 'https')));

select * from bookmarks where starts_with(url, 'https') is true;

select *
from
	users left join (
		select * from bookmarks where starts_with(url, 'https') is true
	) as bookmarks_secure 
		on users.id = bookmarks_secure.user_id
limit 10;

```
- Lateral joins
```sql
select *
from
	users left join bookmarks on users.id = bookmarks.user_id
limit 10;

-- we want to report everyone latest bookmarks
select *
from
	users left join (
		select * from bookmarks where user_id = users.id order by id desc limit 1
	) as most_recent_bookmark on true;
-- this won't work as we are referencing parent id into child table. to use this we need add a word 'lateral'
select *
from
	users left join lateral (
		select * from bookmarks where user_id = users.id order by id desc limit 1
	) as most_recent_bookmark on true;

-- lateral joins are expensive, it is N+1 problem, if there are million of rows, then we are running this query million times.
```
- ROWS FROM
```sql
select generate_series('2024-01-01'::date, '2024-01-31'::date, '3 day')::date as date;

select generate_series(0,100,2)::int as date;

select unnest(ARRAY[1,2,3,4,5]) as tag_name;

-- few more
-- json_to_recordset()
-- jsonb_to_recordset()
-- regexp_matches
-- string _to_table
```
- Filling gaps in sequences
```sql
select sale_date, sum(amount) from sales group by sale_date order by sale_date asc;

-- suppose when I see the data, there is no data for date 3, then this seems like a missing data
-- here we can generate a series and join the data

select  all_dates.sale_date::date, coalesce(total_amount, 0)
from
	generate_series('2024-01-01'::date, '2024-01-31'::date, '1 day')
		as alldates(sale_date)
	left join (
		select sale_date, sum(amount) as total_amount from sales
		group by sale_date
	) as sales on sales.sale_date = all_dates.sale_date;

-- coalesce: this function provides first value which is not null.
-- coalesca(null, null, null, null, 2, 3, 0, 1)
-- this will provide 2  
```
- Subquery elimination
```sql
-- users that have > 16 bookmarks

 select user_id, count(*)
 from bookmarks 
 group by user_id
 having count(*) > 16;

select * from users where id in (
	select user_id
	 from bookmarks 
	 group by user_id
	 having count(*) > 16;
);

-- there are cases where "exists" will work better and "exists" allow the reference of outer table to inner.
```
- Combining queries
```sql
-- union
select 1
union
select 2; -- work
-- you must have same number of columns and same data types
select 1
union
select 2, 3; -- won't work

select generate_series(1,5)
intersect
select generate_series(3,7);
```
