- Searching with LIKE
```sql
select * from movies
where
	title like '%batman%'
order by releaseyear desc, title desc;

-- if want to select case insensitive data, you have ilike
select * from movies
where
	title ilike '%batman%'
	or
	plot ilike '%arkham%'
order by releaseyear desc, title desc;

-- this is not a good solution, search engine wise
```
- Vectors, queries, and ranks
```sql
select title, to_tsvector(title) from movies limit 50;
select to_tsquery('star');

-- we'll going to use these things together to get something useful
select title
from movies
where
	to_tsvector(title) @@ to_tsquery('star')
limit 50;

select title
from movies
where
	to_tsvector(title) @@ to_tsquery('star & wars')
limit 50;
-- here we use &, which means both star and wars should be present
-- or we can use pipe |, this will work for or
-- or we can use <-->, this means star and wars should beside each other
-- negate: 'star & trek & !generations'
```
- WebSearch
```sql
/*

functions we have at our disposal for tsquery
- plainto_tsquery('star trek')
	- it will give tsquery('star & trek')
- phraseto_*: it follows followed_by order: a<-->b

finally we have "websearcg_to_tsquery"
*/

select websearch_to_tsquery('"star wars" +clone') as web;
-- you can use everything what we can do with google search: +, -, or
```
