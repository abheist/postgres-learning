- Functional indexes
```sql
-- Storing a computed result in an index is known as functional index, means, the out of any function. It is more likely as a computed column, but instead, we are storing a result in an index.

select *, split_part(email, '@', 2) from users limit 10;
-- here we are fetching everything + domain of an email. If we want to an indexing on domain, we can do

create index domain on users((split_part(email, '@', 2)));
-- remember to open another parenthesis under table_name users(())

-- to validate that, we can do explain
explain select * from users
	where
	split_part(email, '@', 2) = 'beer.com'
limit 10;
-- be careful with the function declared, if anything with in the function change at query, it will not use the index

-- one use-case of this can be lower(email)
```
- Duplicate indexes
```sql
create index email on users (email);
create index email_is_pro on users (email, is_pro);

-- current we have duplicate index on email and it is totally normal, if we do explain
explain select * from users where email = 'abhishek@gmail.com';
-- you will see that email index is getting used
-- but what if we drop email index
drop index email;
explain select * from users where email = 'abhishek@gmail.com';
-- now you'll see that email_is_pro is getting used.

-- You can delete the first index even in prod, because second index will fulfil the need of first index but not vice-versa.
```
- Hash indexes
```sql
-- Hash index is only useful for strinct equallity lookups
-- it is similar to creating btree index and it used different data structure which is optimized for hashes and this makes it more faster and performant that btree indexes

create index email_btree on users using btree(email);
create index email_hash on users using hash(email);

explain select * from users where email = 'abhishek@gmail.com';
-- uses hash index

explain select * from users where email < 'abhishek@gmail.com';
-- uses btree index

explain select * from users where email like 'abhishek%';
-- does parallel scan on table

-- Prior to postgres 10, hash was not recommended
```
- Naming indexes
```sql
-- Index names are not global to database
-- but they are global to schema
-- so if you have index on email and we named it email
-- and if you have another index on email and you name it email, it will be errored

-- common pattern to follow
-- {tablename}_{column(s)}_{type}
-- type can be: idx, unique, check
